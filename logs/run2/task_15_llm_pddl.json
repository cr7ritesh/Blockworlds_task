  "prompt": "The robot has four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack. The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\npickup: allows the arm to pick up a block from the table if it is clear and the arm is empty. After the pickup action, the arm will be holding the block, and the block will no longer be on the table or clear.\nputdown: allows the arm to put down a block on the table if it is holding a block. After the putdown action, the arm will be empty, and the block will be on the table and clear.\nstack: allows the arm to stack a block on top of another block if the arm is holding the top block and the bottom block is clear. After the stack action, the arm will be empty, the top block will be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will no longer be clear.\nunstack: allows the arm to unstack a block from on top of another block if the arm is empty and the top block is clear. After the unstack action, the arm will be holding the top block, the top block will no longer be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will be clear. \nNow consider a planning problem. The problem description is: \n You have 10 blocks. \nb2 is on top of b3. \nb7 is on top of b1. \nb10 is on top of b8. \nb3 is on top of b6. \nb6 is on top of b9. \nb5 is on top of b4. \nb9 is on top of b10. \nb4 is on top of b2. \nb1 is on the table. \nb8 is on the table. \nb7 is clear. \nb5 is clear. \nYour arm is empty. \nYour goal is to move the blocks. \nb1 should be on top of b5. \nb2 should be on top of b10. \nb5 should be on top of b3. \nb7 should be on top of b4. \nb8 should be on top of b7. \nb9 should be on top of b2. \nb10 should be on top of b8. \nProvide me with BOTH the domain PDDL file AND the problem PDDL file that describes the planning problem. Format your response as follows:\nDOMAIN:\n[domain PDDL content]\n\nPROBLEM:\n[problem PDDL content]\n\nMake sure both files use consistent naming and types. Do not provide any other explanations.",
