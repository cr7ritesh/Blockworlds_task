Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:

Initial State:
- robot2 is in room3
- robot1 is in room2
- ball1 is in room3
- ball2 and ball3 are in room1
- ball4 is in room3
- Both robots' grippers are free

Goal State:
- ball1, ball2, and ball4 are in room2
- ball3 is in room3

Plan:

1. Robot2 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room3.
2. Robot2 moves from room3 to room2.
3. Robot2 drops ball1 in room2 with its left gripper.
4. Robot2 picks up ball4 with its left gripper in room2.
5. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
6. Robot2 moves from room2 to room3.
7. Robot1 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room1.
8. Robot1 picks up ball3 with its right gripper in room1.
9. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
10. Robot1 drops ball2 and ball3 in room2 with its left and right grippers respectively.

Final State:
- All balls are in their designated rooms as per the goal state.
- Both robots' grippers are free.

This plan ensures that the robots work efficiently by minimizing the number of moves and pick/drop actions, making it an optimal solution to the given problem.
