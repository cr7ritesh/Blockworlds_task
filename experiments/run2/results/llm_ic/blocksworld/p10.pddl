Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem:

1. pickup b1
2. stack b1 on b7
3. pickup b2
4. stack b2 on b5
5. pickup b3
6. stack b3 on b2
7. pickup b4
8. stack b4 on b1
9. pickup b5
10. stack b5 on b6
11. pickup b7
12. stack b7 on b3

This plan ensures that the blocks are stacked in the desired order, with each block stacked on top of the correct lower block. The plan also makes efficient use of the actions, with no unnecessary moves.
