Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. unstack b1 from b2
2. putdown b1
3. unstack b8 from b3
4. putdown b8
5. unstack b2 from b4
6. putdown b2
7. unstack b5 from b7
8. putdown b5
9. unstack b3 from b7
10. putdown b3
11. pickup b1
12. stack b1 on b8
13. pickup b2
14. stack b2 on b3
15. pickup b5
16. stack b5 on b3
17. pickup b4
18. stack b4 on b2
19. pickup b8
20. stack b8 on b7

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with b1 on top of b8, b2 on top of b3, b3 on top of b5, b4 on top of b2, and b8 on top of b7.
