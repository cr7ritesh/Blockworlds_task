Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

- Pickup b6
- Stack b6 on b2
- Pickup b5
- Stack b5 on b3
- Pickup b8
- Stack b8 on b9
- Pickup b9
- Stack b9 on b10
- Pickup b10
- Stack b10 on b1
- Pickup b11
- Stack b11 on b12
- Pickup b12
- Stack b12 on b8
- Pickup b1
- Stack b1 on b6

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with each block stacked on top of the specified other block. The plan also respects the constraints of the domain, such as ensuring the arm is empty before picking up a new block and only stacking blocks when the bottom block is clear.
