Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. unstack b6 from b4
2. putdown b6
3. unstack b1 from b3
4. putdown b1
5. unstack b3 from b2
6. putdown b3
7. pickup b6
8. stack b6 on b2
9. pickup b3
10. stack b3 on b5
11. pickup b1
12. stack b1 on b6

This plan ensures that the blocks are moved according to the desired configuration, with b1 on top of b6, b3 on top of b5, and b6 on top of b2.
