Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. unstack b2 from b3
2. putdown b2
3. unstack b5 from b1
4. putdown b5
5. unstack b3 from b9
6. putdown b3
7. unstack b1 from b4
8. putdown b1
9. unstack b8 from b6
10. putdown b8
11. unstack b6 from b9
12. putdown b6
13. pickup b4
14. stack b4 on b8
15. pickup b8
16. stack b8 on b7
17. pickup b5
18. stack b5 on b3
19. pickup b3
20. stack b3 on b1
21. pickup b2
22. stack b2 on b5
23. pickup b9
24. stack b9 on b2

This plan ensures that the blocks are moved according to the desired configuration while minimizing the number of steps. It also takes into consideration the constraints of the robot's actions and the current state of the blocks.
