Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem:

1. pickup b5
2. stack b5 on b1
3. unstack b3 from b2
4. stack b3 on b5
5. pickup b4
6. stack b4 on b3

This plan first moves block b5 to be on top of b1, creating a stack of [b5, b1]. Then, it moves block b3 to the top of b5, resulting in a stack of [b3, b5, b1]. Finally, it picks up block b4 and places it on top of b3, achieving the desired configuration of [b4, b3, b5, b1].
