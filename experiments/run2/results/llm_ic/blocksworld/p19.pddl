Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. pickup b6
2. stack b6 on b12
3. pickup b7
4. stack b7 on b4
5. pickup b8
6. stack b8 on b3
7. pickup b9
8. stack b9 on b2
9. pickup b5
10. stack b5 on b10
11. pickup b11
12. stack b11 on b7
13. pickup b12
14. stack b12 on b11

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with each block stacked on top of the specified other block. The plan also respects the constraints of the domain, such as ensuring the arm is empty before picking up a new block and only stacking blocks when the bottom block is clear.
