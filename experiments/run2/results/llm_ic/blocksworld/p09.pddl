Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

- Pickup b1
- Stack b1 on b2
- Pickup b2
- Stack b2 on b6
- Pickup b3
- Stack b3 on b7
- Pickup b5
- Stack b5 on b3
- Pickup b6
- Stack b6 on b5
- Pickup b7
- Stack b7 on b4

This plan ensures that the blocks are stacked in the desired configuration, with each block stacked on top of the correct lower block. The plan also respects the constraints of the domain, such as ensuring the arm is empty before picking up a new block and only stacking blocks when the bottom block is clear.
