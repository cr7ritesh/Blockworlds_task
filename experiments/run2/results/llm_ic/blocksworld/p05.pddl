Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. Unstack b4 from b1
2. Putdown b4
3. Unstack b1 from b2
4. Putdown b1
5. Unstack b3 from b2
6. Putdown b3
7. Pickup b1
8. Stack b1 on b3
9. Pickup b3
10. Stack b3 on b5

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with b1 on top of b3 and b3 on top of b5.
