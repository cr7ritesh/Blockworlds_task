Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem:

1. Unstack b2 from b3
2. Putdown b2
3. Unstack b3 from b1
4. Putdown b3
5. Pickup b2
6. Stack b2 on b3

This plan first unstacks and puts down b2 and b3, ensuring they are separate and on the table. Then it picks up b2 and stacks it on top of b3, achieving the desired configuration.
