Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. unstack b1 from b3
2. putdown b1
3. unstack b3 from b2
4. putdown b3
5. pickup b2
6. stack b2 on b3
7. stack b3 on b1

This plan first unstacks and puts down blocks b1 and b3 so that they are on the table. Then it picks up block b2 and stacks it on b3, followed by stacking b3 on top of b1, achieving the desired configuration.
