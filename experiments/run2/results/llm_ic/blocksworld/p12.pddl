Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem:

1. pickup b2
2. stack b2 on b8
3. pickup b3
4. stack b3 on b2
5. pickup b5
6. stack b5 on b6
7. pickup b7
8. stack b7 on b1
9. putdown b1
10. stack b1 on b3
11. putdown b4
12. stack b4 on b7
13. putdown b6
14. stack b6 on b4

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with each block stacked on top of the specified lower block. The plan also takes into account the constraints of the robot's actions and the current state of the blocks.
