Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem:

1. pickup b2
2. stack b2 on b3
3. unstack b1 from b3
4. stack b1 on b2
5. unstack b5 from b1
6. stack b5 on b6
7. unstack b7 from b2
8. stack b7 on b8
9. unstack b3 from b2
10. stack b3 on b5
11. unstack b4 from b6
12. stack b4 on b1
13. pickup b9
14. stack b9 on b4

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with each block stacked on top of the specified lower block. The plan also takes into account the constraints of the robot's actions and the current state of the blocks.
