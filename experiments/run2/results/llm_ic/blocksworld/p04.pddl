Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

1. Unstack b2 from b4
2. Putdown b2
3. Unstack b1 from b3
4. Putdown b1
5. Unstack b4 from b1
6. Putdown b4
7. Pickup b2
8. Stack b2 on b3
9. Pickup b1
10. Stack b1 on b2
11. Pickup b4
12. Stack b4 on b3

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with b1 on top of b2, b2 on top of b3, and b3 on top of b4.
