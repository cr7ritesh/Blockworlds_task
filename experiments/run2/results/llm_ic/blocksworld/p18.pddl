Here is an optimal plan to solve the new planning problem: 

- unstack b10 from b2
- putdown b10
- unstack b2 from b5
- putdown b2
- unstack b5 from b3
- putdown b5
- unstack b7 from b1
- putdown b7
- unstack b1 from b9
- putdown b1
- pickup b4
- stack b4 on b11
- stack b1 on b4
- stack b3 on b7
- stack b7 on b2
- stack b6 on b5
- stack b5 on b4
- stack b8 on b3
- stack b11 on b8
- stack b9 on b11
- stack b10 on b9

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with each block stacked on top of the specified other block. The plan also takes into account the constraints of the robot's actions and the current state of the blocks.
