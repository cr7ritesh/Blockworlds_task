The optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks is as follows: 

- **unstack b1 from b3**
    - This action will leave b1 in the arm and b3 clear on the table.
- **putdown b1 on the table**
    - Now both b1 and b3 are on the table, and the arm is empty.
- **pickup b3 from the table**
    - After this action, the arm will be holding b3.
- **stack b3 on top of b1**
    - This will place b3 on top of b1 as desired.
- **pickup b2 from the table**
    - Now the arm is holding b2.
- **stack b2 on top of b3**
    - This final action will achieve the desired configuration with b2 on top of b3, and b3 on top of b1.

This plan consists of 6 actions, and no fewer steps are needed to achieve the desired configuration, making this the optimal plan.
