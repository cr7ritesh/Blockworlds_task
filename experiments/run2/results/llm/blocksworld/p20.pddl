Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

1. pickup(b6)
2. stack(b2, b6)
3. pickup(b8)
4. stack(b9, b8)
5. pickup(b5)
6. stack(b3, b5)
7. pickup(b1)
8. stack(b6, b1)

The plan achieves the desired configuration with the minimum number of steps required to rearrange the blocks. It starts by picking up block b6, stacking it on b2, then repeats the process for the remaining blocks in the desired configuration. This plan assumes that the robot has the necessary reach and mobility to access all the blocks and perform the stacking operations without any collisions or interference.
