Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

1. unstack b8 from b9
2. unstack b5 from b1
3. unstack b1 from b3
4. unstack b7 from b2
5. putdown b2
6. putdown b7
7. pickup b2
8. stack b2 on b7
9. pickup b8
10. stack b8 on b7
11. pickup b3
12. stack b3 on b8
13. pickup b5
14. stack b5 on b3
15. pickup b1
16. stack b1 on b2
17. pickup b4
18. stack b4 on b1
19. pickup b6
20. stack b6 on b5
21. pickup b9
22. stack b9 on b4

In this plan, the robot first clears the blocks that are currently on top of the ones we want to move by unstacking them and putting them down on the table. Then, it picks up the blocks in the order necessary to achieve the desired configuration, stacking them accordingly. Finally, it picks up and stacks the remaining blocks on top. 

This plan assumes that the robot has full knowledge of the current configuration and can accurately perform the actions without any errors.
