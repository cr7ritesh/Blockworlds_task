Here is an optimal plan to solve the given planning problem: 

1. pickup b6
2. stack b6 on b5
3. pickup b1
4. stack b1 on b7
5. pickup b3
6. stack b3 on b1
7. pickup b2
8. stack b2 on b3
9. unstack b4 from b7
10. putdown b4
11. pickup b5
12. stack b5 on b4
13. pickup b7
14. stack b7 on b3

In this plan, the robot first creates a stack of blocks b6 and b5, then places b1 on b7, followed by stacking b3 and b2 on b1. After that, it removes b4 from b7 and places it on the table, and finally, stacks b5 and b7 on top of b4 and b3, respectively. 

The plan ensures that the goal configuration of the blocks is achieved, with each block stacked on top of the correct other block.
