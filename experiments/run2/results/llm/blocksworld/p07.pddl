Here is an optimal plan to achieve the described goal: 

- pickup b5
- putdown b5
- pickup b3
- stack b3 on b5
- pickup b4
- stack b4 on b3

This plan ensures that the blocks are arranged in the desired configuration, with b3 on top of b5, and b4 on top of b3. Each action in the plan is valid given the initial state and the constraints of the domain.
