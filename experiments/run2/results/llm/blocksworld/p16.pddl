Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

1. pickup b1
2. stack b1 on b5
3. pickup b2
4. stack b2 on b10
5. pickup b5
6. stack b5 on b3
7. pickup b7
8. stack b7 on b4
9. pickup b8
10. stack b8 on b7
11. pickup b9
12. stack b9 on b2
13. pickup b10
14. stack b10 on b8

The plan consists of 14 steps, and at each step, the robot performs one of the four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, or unstack. The blocks are rearranged to match the desired configuration.
