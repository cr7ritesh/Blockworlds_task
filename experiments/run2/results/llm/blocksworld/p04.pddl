Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

- pickup(b3)
- stack(b3, b2)
- unstack(b1, b4)
- stack(b1, b2)

First, the arm picks up block b3, which is currently clear. Then, it stacks b3 on top of b2. Next, the arm unstacks b1 from b4, leaving the arm holding b1. Finally, the arm stacks b1 on top of b2, achieving the desired configuration. 

This plan takes four steps and results in the following configuration: 

- b1 is on top of b2.
- b2 is on top of b3.
- b3 is on top of b4.
- The arm is now empty and ready for further tasks.
