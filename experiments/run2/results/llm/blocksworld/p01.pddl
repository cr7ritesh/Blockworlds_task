The optimal plan to achieve the described goal is as follows:

- pickup b1
- stack b1 on b2
- unstack b1 from b2
- putdown b1

At the beginning of the plan, b2 is on top of b3, and b3 is on top of b1. By moving b1 to the top of b2 and then back down to the table, we create a clear path to manipulate b3 without affecting b2. After the plan is executed, the configuration will be as desired: b2 on top of b3, and b3 on top of b1.
