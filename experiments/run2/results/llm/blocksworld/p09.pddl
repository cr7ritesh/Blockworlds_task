Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

1. pickup b1
2. stack b1 on b2
3. pickup b5
4. stack b5 on b6
5. pickup b3
6. stack b3 on b7
7. pickup b6
8. putdown b6
9. pickup b7
10. putdown b7
11. pickup b4
12. stack b7 on b4

This plan involves a sequence of pickup, stack, and putdown actions to manipulate the blocks and achieve the desired configuration.
