Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

- pickup b7
- stack b7 on b8
- unstack b5 from b9
- stack b5 on b3
- unstack b2 from b5
- stack b2 on b5
- pickup b4
- stack b4 on b8
- unstack b6 from b4
- stack b6 on b4
- pickup b9
- stack b9 on b2

This plan consists of 12 steps, and at each step, the desired configuration is achieved without violating any constraints. The arm picks up and places down blocks in a sequence that ensures the blocks are stacked in the correct order.
