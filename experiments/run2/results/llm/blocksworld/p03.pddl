Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

- pickup b2
- stack b2 on b1
- unstack b3 from b1
- pickup b3
- putdown b3
- pickup b4
- stack b3 on b4

This plan consists of 7 actions, and achieves the goal state where b2 is on top of b1, and b3 is on top of b4. The arm is empty in the final state, and all blocks are in their desired positions.
