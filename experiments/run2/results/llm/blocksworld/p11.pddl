To achieve the desired configuration of blocks, the robot can perform the following sequence of actions:

- **unstack b8** from b3
- **putdown** b3
- **pickup** b1
- **stack** b1 on b8
- **pickup** b3
- **stack** b3 on b5
- **unstack** b2 from b4
- **stack** b2 on b3
- **pickup** b4
- **stack** b4 on b2
- **pickup** b8
- **stack** b8 on b7

This sequence of actions results in the desired configuration, with b1 on top of b8, b2 on top of b3, b3 on top of b5, b4 on top of b2, and b8 on top of b7. The robot's arm is now empty, and all blocks are securely stacked as required.
