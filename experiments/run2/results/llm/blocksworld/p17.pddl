Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

1. pickup b9
2. stack b9 on b10
3. unstack b10 from b7
4. stack b10 on b9
5. unstack b7 from b3
6. stack b7 on b2
7. pickup b5
8. stack b5 on b4
9. pickup b6
10. stack b6 on b10
11. pickup b11
12. stack b11 on b1

This plan consists of 12 steps, and at each step, the robot performs one of the four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, or unstack. The plan transforms the initial configuration of blocks to the desired configuration while maintaining stability and avoiding collisions.
