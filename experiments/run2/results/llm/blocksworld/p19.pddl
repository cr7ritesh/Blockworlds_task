Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired configuration of blocks: 

1. pickup(b6)
2. stack(b6, b12)
3. pickup(b7)
4. stack(b7, b4)
5. pickup(b8)
6. stack(b8, b3)
7. pickup(b9)
8. stack(b9, b2)
9. pickup(b10)
10. stack(b10, b8)
11. pickup(b11)
12. stack(b11, b7)
13. pickup(b12)
14. stack(b12, b11)
15. pickup(b5)
16. stack(b5, b10)

This plan consists of 16 steps, and at each step, one of the four actions (pickup, putdown, stack, or unstack) is performed. The plan transforms the initial configuration of blocks to the desired configuration, ensuring that the blocks are stacked in the correct order.
