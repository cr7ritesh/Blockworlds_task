  "knowledge_graph_context": "The error \"Missing closing parenthesis | PDDL syntax error\" in PDDL indicates that there is an issue with the syntax of your PDDL code, specifically with missing parentheses. This usually happens when there are an incorrect number of opening and closing parentheses, or they are misplaced.\n\nTo fix this error:\n1. Review the structure of your PDDL code: Ensure that each function, predicate, or expression that requires parentheses has the correct number and placement of both opening and closing parentheses.\n2. Use indentation and formatting for clarity: Format your code with proper indentation and line breaks to make it easier to spot missing or misplaced parentheses.\n3. Utilize a PDDL linter or validator: There are tools available that can parse your PDDL code and identify syntax errors, including missing parentheses. These tools can help you pinpoint the exact location of the error.\n4. Check for balanced parentheses: Make sure that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and vice versa. Pay attention to the scope and nesting of parentheses to ensure they are properly balanced.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\nIncorrect PDDL code with missing closing parenthesis:\n\n(define (domain blocksworld-4ops)\n   ...\n   (action move\n      :parameters (?block - block ?x - place ?y - place)\n      :precondition (and (on ?block ?x) (clear ?y))\n      :effect (and (not (on ?block ?x)) (on ?block ?y) (clear ?x))\n;; Missing closing parenthesis here\n\nCorrect PDDL code:\n\n(define (domain blocksworld-4ops)\n   ...\n   (action move\n      :parameters (?block - block ?x - place ?y - place)\n      :precondition (and (on ?block ?x) (clear ?y))\n      :effect (and (not (on ?block ?x)) (on ?block ?y) (clear ?x))) ;; Added closing parenthesis here\n\nAs for your specific domains (blocksworld-4ops, gripper-strips, and logistics), remember to review the syntax and structure of your PDDL code, ensuring that all predicates, functions, and expressions are properly formatted with the correct number of opening and closing parentheses.\n\nRegarding ALFWORLD tasks and inferring initial states from trajectory data, the provided context does not include specific details about ALFWORLD. However, in ALFWORLD tasks, initial states can be inferred from trajectory data by analyzing the sequence of actions and observations. You can identify the initial state by observing the first state before any actions are taken. This initial state provides the starting point for the planning problem, from which the agent can then reason and plan subsequent actions.",
