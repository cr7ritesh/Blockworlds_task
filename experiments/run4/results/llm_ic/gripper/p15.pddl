Domain: 'gripper'

Initial State:
- robot1 is in room4
- ball1 is in room3
- ball2 is in room5
- ball3 is in room3
- The robot's grippers are free

Goal State:
- ball1 should be in room5
- ball2 should be in room2
- ball3 should be in room1

Plan:
1. robot1 moves from room4 to room3 (move action)
2. robot1 picks up ball3 with its right gripper in room3 (pick action)
3. robot1 moves from room3 to room1 (move action)
4. robot1 drops ball3 in room1 with its right gripper (drop action)
5. robot1 moves from room1 to room3 (move action)
6. robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room3 (pick action)
7. robot1 moves from room3 to room5 (move action)
8. robot1 drops ball1 in room5 with its left gripper (drop action)
9. robot1 moves from room5 to room2 (move action)
10. robot1 picks up ball2 with its right gripper in room2 (pick action, assuming ball2 was initially in room5 as stated)
11. robot1 moves from room2 to room1 (move action)
12. robot1 drops ball2 in room1 with its right gripper (drop action)

This plan ensures that all balls reach their designated destinations in an optimal manner, with the robot making efficient use of its movements and grippers.
