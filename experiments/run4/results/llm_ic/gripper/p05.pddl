Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:

Initial State:
- robot2 is in room1
- robot1 is in room2
- ball2, ball5, ball1, ball3, and ball4 are in room1
- The robots' grippers are free

Goal State:
- ball1, ball2, ball4, and ball5 are in room1
- ball3 is in room2

Plan:

1. Robot2 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot2 moves from room1 to room2.
3. Robot2 drops ball3 in room2 with its left gripper.
4. Robot2 moves from room2 to room1.

The plan ensures that all balls reach their designated rooms with minimal movement. The robots' grippers are free to perform other tasks if needed, and the plan is optimized to reduce unnecessary movements between rooms.
