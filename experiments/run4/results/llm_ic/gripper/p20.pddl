Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:
Initial State:
- robot1, robot2, robot3, and robot4 are in room1
- ball1 is in room2
- ball2 is in room3
- All robots' grippers are free

Goal State:
- ball1 is in room2
- ball2 is in room3

Plan:
1. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2
2. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room2
3. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1
4. Robot1, Robot2, or Robot3 moves from room1 to room3 (let's say Robot2)
5. Robot2 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room3
6. Robot2 moves from room3 to room1
7. All robots move from room1 to room2 (they can move together or one by one)
8. Robot1 drops ball1 in room2 with its left gripper
9. Robot2 or Robot3 moves from room2 to room3 (let's say Robot3)
10. Robot3 drops ball2 in room3 with its left gripper

Final State:
- All robots are in room2
- ball1 is in room2
- ball2 is in room3
- All grippers are free

This plan ensures that the balls reach their destinations while minimizing the overall movement of the robots. It also assumes that multiple robots can move together between rooms to optimize the plan.
