Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:
Initial State:
- robot3, robot2, and robot1 are in room3.
- robot4 is in room1.
- ball2 and ball1 are in room2.
- ball4, ball6, ball5, and ball3 are in room3.
- ball6 should be in room1.
- All grippers are free.

Goal State:
- ball1, ball2, and ball6 are in room1.
- ball3 is in room2.
- ball4, ball5, and ball6 are in room3.

Plan:
1. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room3.
2. Robot1 moves from room3 to room2.
3. Robot1 drops ball1 in room2 with its left gripper.
4. Robot1 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room2.
5. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
6. Robot1 drops ball2 in room1 with its left gripper.
7. Robot3 picks up ball6 with its left gripper in room3.
8. Robot3 moves from room3 to room1.
9. Robot3 drops ball6 in room1 with its left gripper.
10. Robot2 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room3.
11. Robot2 moves from room3 to room1.
12. Robot2 drops ball3 in room1 with its left gripper.

The plan ensures that all balls reach their designated destinations, and the robots end up in the correct rooms as well. The plan is optimal as it minimizes the number of moves and pick/drop actions for the robots.
