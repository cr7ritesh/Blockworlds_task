Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:
Initial State:
- robot3 is in room2
- robot1 is in room1
- robot4 is in room1
- robot2 is in room2
- ball5, ball1 are in room1
- ball3, ball2, ball4 are in room2
- All robots' grippers are free

Goal State:
- ball1, ball2, ball4 are in room2
- ball3, ball5 are in room1

Plan:
1. Robot1 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room2.
2. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
3. Robot1 drops ball3 in room1 with its left gripper.
4. Robot3 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room1.
5. Robot3 moves from room1 to room2.
6. Robot3 drops ball1 in room2 with its left gripper.

The plan is optimal as it minimizes the number of moves and pick/drop actions. Each robot only needs to make one trip between the rooms, and they cooperate to move the balls efficiently.
