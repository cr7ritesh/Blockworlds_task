Problem:

Initial State:

- robot3 is in room2
- robot2 is in room1
- robot1 is in room2
- ball5 is in room1
- ball4 is in room2
- ball2 is in room2
- ball3 is in room1
- ball1 is in room2
- All grippers are free

Goal State:

- ball1 should be in room1
- ball2 should be a room1
- ball3 should be in room2
- ball4 should be in room1
- ball5 should be in room1

Plan:

1. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room2.
2. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
3. Robot1 drops ball1 in room1 with its left gripper.
4. Robot1 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room1.
5. Robot3 picks up ball4 with its right gripper in room2.
6. Robot3 moves from room2 to room1.
7. Robot3 drops ball4 in room1 with its right gripper.
8. Robot2 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
9. Robot2 moves from room1 to room2.
10. Robot2 drops ball3 in room2 with its left gripper.

Final State:

- All balls are in their designated rooms as per the goal state.
- Robots are in room1 (robot1 and robot2) and room2 (robot3).
- Grippers are free.

This plan ensures that all balls are transported to their correct destinations using optimal movements of the robots between rooms.
