Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:

Initial State:

- robot1 is in room2
- ball1 is in room3
- ball2 is in room2
- ball3 is in room2
- ball5 is in room2
- ball4 is in room1
- The robot's grippers are free

Goal State:

- ball1 should be in room3
- ball2 should be in room1
- ball3 should be in room2
- ball4 should be in room2
- ball5 should be in room3

Plan:

1. robot1 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room2
2. robot1 moves from room2 to room1
3. robot1 drops ball2 in room1 with its left gripper
4. robot1 picks up ball5 with its left gripper in room1
5. robot1 moves from room1 to room2
6. robot1 drops ball5 with its left gripper in room2
7. robot1 picks up ball4 with its left gripper in room2
8. robot1 moves from room2 to room3
9. robot1 drops ball4 with its left gripper in room3
10. robot1 picks up ball5 with its left gripper in room3
11. robot1 moves from room3 to room2
12. robot1 drops ball5 with its left gripper in room2

This plan ensures that all balls reach their designated destinations while minimizing the robot's movements.
