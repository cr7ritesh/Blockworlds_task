Domain: 'gripper'

Problem:

Initial State:
- robot1 is in room1
- robot2 is in room1
- ball1 is in room1
- ball2 is in room1
- both robots' grippers are free

Goal State:
- ball1 should be in room1
- ball2 should be in room1

Plan:

1. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot2 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room1.
3. Robot1 and Robot2 keep the balls in their left grippers and the problem is solved.

The plan ensures that both balls are in room1 as required by the goal state, and it is optimal as it requires the minimum number of moves and no unnecessary actions.
