Problem:

Initial State:

- robot1 is in room4
- robot2 is in room4
- robot3 is in room1
- ball1, ball2, and ball3 are in room1
- ball4 is in room2
- All robots' grippers are free

Goal State:

- ball1, ball2, and ball3 are in room1
- ball4 is in room2

Plan:

1. Robot3 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot3 moves from room1 to room3.
3. Robot3 drops ball3 in room3 with its left gripper.
4. Robot3 moves from room3 to room1.
5. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room4.
6. Robot2 picks up ball4 with its left gripper in room4.
7. Robot1 moves from room4 to room1.
8. Robot2 moves from room4 to room2.
9. Robot1 drops ball1 in room1 with its left gripper.
10. Robot2 drops ball4 in room2 with its left gripper.
