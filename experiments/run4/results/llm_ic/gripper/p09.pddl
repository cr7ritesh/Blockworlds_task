5. Robot1 moves from room1 to room4.
6. Robot1 drops ball2 in room4 with its left gripper.
7. Robot3 picks up ball5 with its left gripper in room3.
8. Robot2 moves from room1 to room2.
9. Robot2 picks up ball4 with its left gripper in room2.
10. Robot2 moves from room2 to room4.
11. Robot2 drops ball4 in room4 with its left gripper.
12. Robot2 picks up ball6 with its right gripper in room4.
13. Robot2 moves from room4 to room2.
14. Robot2 drops ball6 in room2 with its right gripper.
15. Robot3 drops ball5 in room3 with its left gripper.
16. Robot2 picks up ball5 with its left gripper in room3.
17. Robot2 moves from room3 to room1.
18. Robot2 drops ball5 in room1 with its left gripper.
19. Robot3 picks up ball7 with its right gripper in room3.
20. Robot3 moves from room3 to room1.
21. Robot3 drops ball7 in room1 with its right gripper.

This plan ensures that all balls reach their designated destinations with minimal moves. Each robot focuses on transporting balls within their nearby rooms, and only moves to another room when necessary.
