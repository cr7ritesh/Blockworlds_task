- Robot4 moves to room1. 
- Robot4 drops ball1 and ball2. 

- Move robot3 to room1. 
- Robot3 picks up ball3 with its left gripper. 
- Robot3 moves to room2. 
- Robot3 drops ball3. 

- Move robot2 to room1.
- Robot2 picks up ball4 with one gripper and ball5 with the other gripper. 

- Move robot1 to room1. 
- Robot1 picks up ball6. 

- All four robots move to room3.
