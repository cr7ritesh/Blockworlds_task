Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem you have described: 

- Move robot3 to room1
- Pick up ball1 with robot3's left gripper
- Move robot3 to room2
- Drop ball1 in room2
- Pick up ball3 with robot3's left gripper
- Move robot3 to room1
- Drop ball3 in room1
- Move robot1 to room2
- Pick up ball2 with robot1's left gripper
- Move robot1 back to room1
- Drop ball2 in room1
- Move robot2 to room1
- Pick up ball4 with robot2's left gripper
- Move robot2 back to room2
- Drop ball4 in room2

In this plan, each robot only needs to make one round trip between the rooms to transport the balls to their correct destinations. The plan ensures that the robots do not conflict with each other and that all balls are transported optimally with minimal moves.
