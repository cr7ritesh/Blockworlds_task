Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem: 

- Move: robot1 moves from room1 to room3.
- Pick: robot1 picks up ball1 from room3.
- Drop: robot1 drops ball1 in room1.
- Pick: robot1 picks up ball2 from room3.
- Drop: robot1 drops ball2 in room1.

This plan involves a total of 5 actions, and it achieves the goal of transporting both balls to room1. The robot first moves to room3, where the balls are initially located, and then picks up and drops each ball in room1.
