The optimal plan to achieve the goal of transporting the balls to their respective destinations is as follows: 

Step 1: Move robot1 from room2 to room1. 

Step 2: Pick up ball2 in room1 with the left gripper. 

Step 3: Move robot1 from room1 to room4. 

Step 4: Drop ball2 in room4. 

Step 5: Pick up ball3 in room4 with the left gripper. 

Step 6: Move robot1 from room4 to room1. 

Step 7: Drop ball3 in room1. 

At this point, we have addressed the goals for ball2 and ball3. Now we can focus on the remaining balls. 

Step 8: Move robot1 from room1 to room2. 

Step 9: Pick up ball1 in room2 with the right gripper. 

Step 10: Move robot1 from room2 to room3. 

Step 11: Drop ball1 in room3. 

Step 12: Pick up ball4 in room3 with the right gripper. 

Step 13: Move robot1 from room3 back to room2. 

Step 14: Drop ball4 in room2. 

With these steps, all the balls are in their designated rooms, and the goal is achieved. 

The sequence of behaviors demonstrates an efficient way for the robot to move and transport the balls to their destinations with minimal backtracking.
