The optimal plan to solve this problem is as follows: 

Step 1: Move robot2 to room2

Step 2: Pick up ball2 with robot2's left gripper

Step 3: Move robot2 to room1

Step 4: Drop ball2 in room1

At this point, we have achieved the goal since ball1 is already in room1, and we have moved ball2 from room2 to room1. Both balls are now in their correct destinations. 

This plan takes 4 steps and ensures that the robots do not need to return to the same room to pick up the other ball, making it more efficient than plans that require backtracking.
