The optimal plan to achieve the goal is as follows: 

Step 1: Pick up ball3 with the robot's gripper in room1. 

Step 2: Move to room2 with ball3. 

Step 3: Drop ball3 in room2. 

Since ball1 and ball2 should remain in room1, there is no need to pick them up or move them, as they are already in their designated locations. 

The plan ensures that all three balls are in their correct destinations as per the goal state.
