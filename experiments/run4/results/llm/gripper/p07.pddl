Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem: 

- Move robot1 from room4 to room2. 
- Pick up ball1 with robot1's left gripper. 
- Move robot1 from room2 to room3. 
- Drop ball1 in room3 with robot1's left gripper. 
- Move robot1 from room3 back to room2. 
- Pick up ball2 with robot1's left gripper. 
- Move robot3 from room1 to room4.
- Pick up ball3 with robot3's left gripper.
- Move robot3 from room4 to room3.
- Drop ball3 in room3 with robot3's left gripper.
- The plan ensures that all three balls reach their designated rooms. 

The sequence of behaviors is as follows: 

1. Move, Pick, Move, Drop, Move, Pick 
2. Move, Pick, Move, Drop 

This plan ensures that the robots' movements are efficient, minimizing the total distance traveled and the number of actions taken. It also ensures that the grippers are used effectively, with each robot carrying a ball whenever possible during movement between rooms.
