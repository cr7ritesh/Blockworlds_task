The optimal plan to solve this problem is as follows: 

Step 1: Robot 1 moves to Room 1. 

Step 2: Robot 1 picks up Ball 3 using its left gripper. 

Step 3: Robot 1 moves to Room 2. 

Step 4: Robot 1 drops Ball 3 in Room 2. 

At this point, all the balls are in their correct rooms, and the goal is achieved. This plan requires only one robot to move between rooms and transport Ball 3, making it the most efficient solution. 

The final state of the world would be: 

- Robot 1 is in Room 2 with its grippers free. 
- Robot 2 is in Room 1 with its grippers free. 
- Ball 1, Ball 2, Ball 4, and Ball 5 are in Room 1. 
- Ball 3 is in Room 2. 

This plan ensures that the balls are transported to their correct rooms using the robots' grippers and movement between rooms.
