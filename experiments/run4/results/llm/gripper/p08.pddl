Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem you have described: 

- Move robot1 from room2 to room1. 
- Pick up ball1 with robot1's left gripper. 
- Pick up ball2 with robot1's right gripper. 
- Move robot1 from room1 to room2. 
- Drop ball1 and ball2 in room2. 
- Move robot3 from room2 to room1. 
- Pick up ball4 and ball5 with robot3's left and right grippers respectively. 
- Move robot2 from room1 to room2. 
- Pick up ball3 with robot2's left gripper. 
- Move robot2 back to room1. 
- Drop ball3 in room1. 
- Move robot3 back to room1 and drop ball4 and ball5. 

This plan ensures that all the balls are transported to their correct destinations using the three robots. The plan is optimal as it minimizes the total distance traveled by the robots and the number of moves and pickups/drop-offs required.
