Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem: 

- Move robot1 from room2 to room1
- Pick up ball4 with the left gripper
- Move robot1 from room1 to room2
- Drop ball4
- Pick up ball2 with the left gripper
- Move robot1 from room2 to room1
- Drop ball2
- Move robot1 from room1 to room3
- Pick up ball1 with the left gripper and ball5 with the right gripper
- Move robot1 from room3 to room2
- Drop ball5
- Move robot1 from room2 to room3
- Drop ball1

The plan ensures that all the balls reach their respective destinations in the fewest moves possible. The robot starts in room2, where it picks up and moves balls to their correct rooms, ending in room3 where the final balls are placed.
