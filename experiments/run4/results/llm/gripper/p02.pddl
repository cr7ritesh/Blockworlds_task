Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem you have described: 

- Move robot2 from room3 to room1.
- Pick up ball2 with the left gripper of robot2 and pick up ball3 with the right gripper of robot2.
- Move robot2 from room1 to room2.
- Drop ball2 and ball3 in room2.
- Move robot1 from room2 to room1.
- Pick up ball1 with the left gripper of robot1 and pick up ball4 with the right gripper of robot1.
- Move robot1 from room1 to room3.
- Drop ball1 and ball4 in room3.

In this plan, both robots work simultaneously to transport the balls to their respective destinations in an efficient manner. The plan ensures that all the preconditions for the 'move', 'pick', and 'drop' actions are satisfied at each step.
