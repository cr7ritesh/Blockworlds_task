Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem: 

- Move robot3 to room3
- Pick up ball3 with robot3's left gripper
- Move robot3 to room1
- Drop ball3 in room1
- Pick up ball1 with robot3's left gripper
- Pick up ball2 with robot3's right gripper
- Move robot3 to room4
- Drop ball1 with robot3's left gripper
- Drop ball2 with robot3's right gripper
- Pick up ball4 with robot2's left gripper
- Move robot2 to room2
- Drop ball4 in room2

This plan ensures that all 4 balls are in their respective destinations, and it only requires the use of 2 out of the 3 robots available. The number of moves is minimized, and the grippers are used efficiently.
