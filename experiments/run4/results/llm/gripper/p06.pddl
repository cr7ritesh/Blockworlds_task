The optimal plan for this problem is as follows: 

Step 1: Move robot2 from room2 to room1. 

Step 2: Robot2 picks up ball1 using its left or right gripper (assuming no preference or restrictions are given). 

Step 3: Robot2 moves from room1 to room3. 

Step 4: Robot2 drops ball1 in room3. 

This plan ensures that ball1 is transported from room1 to room3 using robot2, while robot1 remains in room3. The plan requires 4 actions and is considered optimal as it directly moves robot2 to retrieve and deliver ball1 without any unnecessary movements or actions.
