Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem you have described: 

- Move robot1 from room1 to room2
- Pick up ball3 with robot1's left gripper
- Pick up ball4 with robot1's right gripper
- Move robot1 from room2 to room1
- Drop ball4 in room1 with robot1's right gripper
- Drop ball3 in room1 with robot1's left gripper
- Move robot1 from room1 to room2
- Pick up ball2 with robot1's left gripper
- Pick up ball1 with robot1's right gripper
- Move robot1 from room2 to room1
- Drop ball1 in room1 with robot1's right gripper
- Drop ball2 in room1 with robot1's left gripper

In this plan, only one robot is required to move back and forth between the rooms to rearrange the balls in their correct destinations. The plan ensures that the robot's grippers are used efficiently by carrying two balls at a time, reducing the number of trips required. 

The state at the end of this sequence of actions will be: 

- robot3 is in room2, robot1 is in room1, robot2 is in room1
- ball1 is in room1, ball2 is in room1, ball3 is in room1, ball4 is in room1
- The robots' grippers are free

This plan ensures that the balls are transported to their correct destinations in an optimal manner, minimizing the number of moves and maximizing the efficiency of the robots' grippers.
