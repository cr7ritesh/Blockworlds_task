  "knowledge_graph_context": "This error occurs when there is a mismatch in the number of opening and closing parentheses in your PDDL code, which is a common issue when working with this language. \n\n**Causes:**\n- Mismatched Parentheses: Forgetting to close an open parenthesis or adding an extra closing parenthesis by mistake.\n- Nested Expressions: PDDL allows for nested expressions, and when dealing with complex expressions, it's easy to lose track of the number of opening and closing parentheses required.\n- Missing Parentheses: Simply forgetting to include a closing parenthesis at the end of an expression.\n\n**Solutions:**\n- **Parenthesis Check:** Carefully review your code, paying close attention to each opening and closing parenthesis. Ensure they are balanced and match up correctly.\n- **Use Indentation and Formatting:** Format your code with consistent indentation. This will help you visualize nested expressions and identify missing or extra parentheses more easily.\n- **Comment and Test:** When working with complex expressions, comment out sections of code to isolate the issue. Test your code in smaller parts to pinpoint where the error occurs.\n- **Use an Editor with Syntax Highlighting:** Many PDDL editors or IDEs provide syntax highlighting, which can help you identify missing or extra parentheses more easily.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the issue and solution:\n\n**Incorrect Code:**\n(define (problem p1)\n   (:domain blocksworld)\n   (:objects blockA blockB)\n   (:init (on table blockA)\n         blockB) ; Missing closing parenthesis here\n   (:goal (and (on blockA blockB)\n              (clear table)))\n)\n\n**Correct Code:**\n(define (problem p1)\n   (:domain blocksworld)\n   (:objects blockA blockB)\n   (:init (on table blockA)\n         (on table blockB)) ; Added missing closing parenthesis\n   (:goal (and (on blockA blockB)\n              (clear table)))\n)\n\nIn the incorrect code, the missing closing parenthesis after `blockB` in the `:init` section caused the error. By reviewing the code and ensuring proper formatting, the missing parenthesis was identified and added in the correct location.",
